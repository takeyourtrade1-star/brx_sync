The Black Lotus has been printed 3 times and each reprint corresponds to a Blueprint. Selling a Black Lotus from the Alpha edition is way different than selling a Black Lotus from the Beta edition.

The API returns a list of Blueprints matching an Expansion.

Properties
Categories, Blueprints and Products have properties. Properties are objects that specify the little details of the items you sell. You are selling a Black Lotus Alpha, that's great, but there is more - you should specify the condition and the language. All these extra details are the Properties.

A die has a number of faces and a color (red die, 6 faces. Blue die, 20 faces). Number of faces and color are Properties.

The Property object tells you all the possible values it can take. For example a condition can be Mint, Near Mint, Slightly Played, Moderately Played, Played, Heavily Played or Poor, but not 'Very Poor'. Very Poor is not an acceptable value for the condition Property.

name
string		The name used to identify the Property
type
'string' | 'boolean'		The type of the Property
possible_values
array		The array of values that are allowed for this Property
Property: condition in Magic The Gathering

Batch Product Operations
Batch operations are the preferred way to operate on many Products at the same time (create, update or delete them). The create, update and delete operations have 3 endpoints, each accepting an array of Products.

Product operations are asynchronous: the endpoint returns immediately and the response is a job. A job has only a string value, the uuid code. You can check the status of the job at the endpoint /jobs using that code.

Create
POST /products/bulk_create
Create multiple Products. The request has a products key containing an array of JSON objects describing the many products you want to create.

You can specify the "error_mode" key for each product to have better control over the validation of the products you are about to create.

blueprint_id
integer	Mandatory	The ID of the Blueprint you want to sell
price
float	Mandatory	The price of the Product, in your currency
quantity
integer	Mandatory	The quantity. If you already have one such Product, it will just increment the quantity (not create a new Product)
description
string	Optional	The description of the Product. Visible to all
error_mode
"strict"	Optional	If specified and set to "strict", the API will fail and not create a Product if you pass a wrong Property. Otherwise, it will return a warning and accept the Product, automatically fixing the wrong Property with its default value. If, for example, you send condition "Plaied" in strict mode, the Product will not be created. In non-strict error_mode instead, the Product will be created with the default condition "Near Mint"
user_data_field
string	Optional	Any text string you want to attach to the Product. You can use it to hold information for interfacing with your local system, your warehouse, or the id on your portal. Not visible anywhere, only visible via API
properties
object	Optional	An object with the Property of this Product. The key is a name of a Property, the value is always one of the possible_values of the Property of the Blueprint you are instantiating
graded
boolean	Optional	If the Product is graded
This API is asynchronous. You will receive back an object containing the UUID of the operation. You can use this inside the jobs endpoint to check the status. The different statues of this operation are described in the Jobs section

Jobs
Job Status
GET /jobs/:uuid
The endpoint for inspecting a Job.

The state of the Job indicates the progress: pending means that it has not begun yet, running means the Job is in progress ,unprocessable means there was an error. completed means the Job finished successfully.

The stats indicate the number of Products processed correctly (ok), processed but with warnings (warning) or not processed at all (error).

Each products specified in the payload appears in the results section, along with the status and the product_id created/updated/deleted on CardTrader. The products keep the same position they had in the payload (job_index) so you know, for example, tnat the second element in the payload will be the second element in the results. In the example we created 3 products, so we got 3 results.

This endpoint has a rate limit of 1 request per second.
If this limit is exceeded, the response will be:

Rate limit exceeded response
{
  "error": "Too many requests: max 1 request per second"
}

CSV Product Operations
You can also manage your Products using CSV files.

Upload
POST /product_imports
You can totally replace your inventory with the content of a CSV file or you can just add new Products. You have to upload one CSV per Game because each Game has different properties. Also, you cannot import more than one file per Game at a time. Differently from other APIs, the POST body is a multipart form containing the following parameters:

POST /product_imports
          
curl https://api.cardtrader.com/api/v2/product_imports \
-H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN]" \
 -F  csv=path_to_csv.csv \
 -F  game_id=1 \
 -F  replace_stock_or_add_to_stock=replace_stock \
 -F  column_names=expansion_code|_|name|quantity|language|condition|_|price_cents \
-G

        
Order object
csv
file		The file to upload
game_id
text		This parameter is the id of the game of your products.
error_mode
strict | null		If specified and set to "strict", the API will fail and not create a Product if you pass a wrong Property. Otherwise, it will return a warning and accept the Product, automatically fixing the wrong Property with its default value. If, for example, you send condition "Plaied" in strict mode, the Product will not be created. In non-strict error_mode instead, the Product will be created with the default condition "Near Mint"
replace_stock_or_add_to_stock
text		This parameter, as the name suggests, can have 2 values: "replace_stock" or "add_to_stock". If you use the first option, your entire stock for that game will be replaced at the end of the import (this option is good if you have your inventory on another platform and want to sync CardTrader to it). If you choose this at the end of the import your entire inventory(per game) is replaced with the content of the csv. Otherwise, the API will add the items you specified to your Products.
column_names
text		This parameter allows you to specify the structure of your CSV file. It's a string composed of the names of the columns separated by a "|" char. You can use any name in the section below.
Allowed Column Names:

name
quantity
bundle
expansion_code
expansion_name
expansion_id
price
price_cents
language
condition
foil
signed
altered
first_edition
expansion_code
mkm_id
user_data_field
tcgplayer_id
scryfall_id
scryfall_id
description
rarity
If there's a column you don't want CardTrader to handle instead of writing its name you can put a "_".

A valid .csv must contain at least one of the following combinations of columns, to allow CardTrader to identify the product:

name, expansion_code
name, expansion_name
name, expansion_id (expansion_id is the CardTrader internal Expansion ID)
name, collector_number, expansion_code
name, collector_number, expansion_name
name, collector_number, expansion_id
collector_number, expansion_code
collector_number, expansion_name
collector_number, expansion_id
mkm_id
tcgplayer_id
scryfall_id
blueprint_id
The API is asynchronous, so it will immediately return a JSON object containing the id of the import operation. You can check its status with the following API.

Example Response
{
  "id": 54345,
  "csv_filename": "mini.csv",

Order Management
Order Lifecycle
Order Lifecycle
Each order has 8 different possible states.

Those states will change over time. They are different depending on if the order was created with CardTraderzero or not.

Standard CardTrader order
Once a customer buys something, this will create an order in a paid state. That means that the store that receives the order has to send it.

Once the seller sends the order, the state of it will go to sent

When the buyer receives the order it will go to arrived

Once the buyer is reviewed or a timeout has expired order will go to done.

CardTrader Zero order
For CardTrader Zero, there's one additional state: hub_pending. The seller will receive every order from CardTrader itself in this state. That means that the card is sold but has not to be sent yet.

Once per week, it will be created a new order in paid state, with all the items of the others. The other orders are set to closed. The seller has to send to CardTrader the merged order. If you are using an external system to manage your stock, for CardTrader Zero orders you should decrement your stock ONLY for hub_pending orders, otherwise you risk to do it twice.

You have to check 3 fields inside the payload:

via_cardtrader_zero
state
hub_pending_order_id of each order_item
(only if you do pre-sales, otherwise this check is not needed)
state	via_cardtrader_zero	Should you
decrement your stock?
hub_pending	true	Yes*
paid	true	No
paid	false	Yes
* = For accounts with pre-sale enabled, you also need to check
if order id is equal to order_item hub_pending_order_id
Special States
If something goes wrong an order can go to these states:
request_for_cancel if one of the seller or the buyer requested cancellation.
canceled if the cancellation request has been accepted
lost if the order gets lost before being arrived

Webhooks
If your app is enabled to receive https calls, and you have entered an endpoint, Full API will notify your endpoint whenever an Order is created, modified or deleted.

For example, the endpoint is called:

When another user orders from you
When setting the order from the graphic interface as shipped or changing its status
When another user marks your order as received
id
integer		A unique UUID for each call to your endpoint
time
integer		Request time as an integer number of seconds since the Epoch
cause
'order'.('create' | 'update' | 'destroy')		The cause of the endpoint call. It may be the creation, updating or removal of an Order
object_class
'Order'		The object that was created, updated or removed
object_id
integer		The id of the object
mode
'test' | 'live'		If the webhook is in production (live) or is in a test
data
json		The webhook payload. In the case of create or update, it is the object itself. In the case of destroy, it is empty.
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "id": "c352e8d0-472c-4d02-9c34-915eda5c45b8",
  "time": 1632240962,
  "cause": "order.update",
  "object_class": "Order",
  "object_id": 733733,

}
DataPayload
When the webhook is of type order.create or order.update, DataPayload is the object of type Order that has been created or modified.

When the webhook is of type order.destroy, DataPayload is empty.

Check the Webhook Signature
It is possible to verify that the received webhook really comes from CardTrader Full API.

Each original request coming from the Full API is signed by a Signature header, which is the base64 representation of the HMAC digest via sha256 of the request body, signed with the app's shared_secret.
